    <h4>Favorite Song</h4>
    <p>I have many songs that I like to listen , all from various artists and various genres.</p>
    <p>I mainly listen to hip hop/rap and have recently been listening to The Weeknd. </p>
    <p>Here is a recent song I have been listening to called <a href="https://youtu.be/ygTZZpVkmKg" target="_blank">After Hours.</a> You may click on the song name to get redirected to youtube.</p>
    <h4>Favorite Movie</h4>
    <p>I watch many movies but by far my favorite will always have to be the sequel of The Hunger Games starring Jennifer Lawerence. I've always loved the concept of the movie and have watched it 3 times over.</p>
    <p>Here is a trailer of the movie if you have never watched it before:</p>
